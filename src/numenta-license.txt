As of Nov 22, 2010, Numenta has promised not to use it's patents and IP to come
after people using HTMs in non-commercial, research applications.

In the end, though, they hold patent rights and can change their mind whenever
they want. Be sure you have checked their website for their latest stance
before putting much effort in.
